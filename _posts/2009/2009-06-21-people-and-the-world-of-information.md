I guess it shouldn't come as a shock to me that there are still people out there who do not believe that the internet is a great medium for information sharing and gathering, but in some cases I see their points. One of the latest authors to do so is Ray Bradbury, who believes that the internet is not something where tangible work can be done and shared. And while I share in his belief that libraries are a persistent and necessary tool in civilization, I don't share his belief that the internet is not a powerful medium in his own. So to satisfy myself, I produced the following binary table:

There, now I feel much better being in the (1,1) column of this binary table of information love. Either way, share your comments on your beliefs about the internet.
