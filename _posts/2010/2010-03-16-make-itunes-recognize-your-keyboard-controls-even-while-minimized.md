In the eternal hunt to make my life a bit easier and more flowing, I was getting tired of having to ALT+TAB out of a game just to change or pause a song. The thing that irked me was that the keyboard controls worked while in focus but as soon as it lost focus it would stop. Well thanks to this nifty little iTunes plugin found at [http://www.everythingitunes.com/os/windows/2008-01-04/mmkeysdll](http://www.everythingitunes.com/os/windows/2008-01-04/mmkeysdll) I can now control iTunes even when minimized!

It appears to work with Windows XP, Vista and 7 without any problem. All you have to do is go to their site, download the mmkeys.dll file to C:\\Users\\your\_username\\AppData\\Roaming\\Apple Computer\\iTunes\\iTunes Plug-ins and restart iTunes! Kudos to the developers of this tool, you have greatly improved my gaming music life!
