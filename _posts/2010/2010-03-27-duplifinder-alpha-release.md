As promised, here is a compiled installer as well as the Visual C# 2008 source code for your enjoyment. A few things to note: I can't guarantee that it will work on your system, I can't guarantee that it will work as advertised, and that all crashes have a reason. For developers I can't guarantee that the source code is readable :). Hopefully you'll see through my poor commenting and naming conventions and see the potential for this code :P. Anyways, this is by no means a finished product, but I am releasing it to one keep myself on schedule, and two make a duplicate file finding program available for free (finally!). The installer may only be 64-bit (the publish options in Visual Studio are so confusing!) so if that's the case you will need to compile it yourself. Mature releases will have a 64 and 32-bit build available (with probably a real and better install system).

As usual, please leave feedback relating to functionality or utter destruction in the comments below, and remember it's alpha software so use at your own risk! It won't delete random files, but don't think it won't actually delete all the files when you select them with the checkbox and choose Erase!
