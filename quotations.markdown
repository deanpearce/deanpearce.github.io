Some of my favourite quotations that I've come across over the years. Proverbs, prominent individuals, books and media. These are the thoughts that make me pause and reflect.

> "When you are studying any matter, or considering any philosophy, ask yourself only what are the facts and what is the truth that the facts bear out.

I suppose we all thought that, one way or another." ― Robert Oppenheimer

Then we shall all, philosophers, scientists, and just ordinary people, be able to take part in the discussion of the question of why it is that we and the universe exist. If we find the answer to that, it would be the ultimate triumph of human reason—for then we would know the mind of God." ― Stephen Hawking

> "There, peeping among the cloud-wrack above a dark tor high up in the mountains, Sam saw a white star twinkle for a while.

Tolkien, The Return of the King

> "We are like butterflies who flutter for a day and think it is forever." ― Carl Sagan, Cosmos
