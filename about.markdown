Hello, I'm Dean Pearce, a software developer based in Ottawa, Canada. I am passionate about software and its impact on the world. My life-long interested in technology evolved into an interest in software and society while in high school. I obtained my Bachelor of Computer Science with a minor in Mathematics from Carleton University in Ottawa, Canada. I enrolled in their Master of Computer Science program, completing most of my study work however I did not complete my thesis. I began my professional career at a local Ottawa company, starting as a student intern and worked my way to the role of technical lead. Currently I work as a senior data engineer for a major Canadian bank.

While work pays the bills, I am passionately interested in technology and its impact on society. From social media to data collection, to future technologies such as augmented reality and AI, I have touched every area either professionally or academically. As an undergraduate my thesis focus was on augmented reality and its application to everyday use. As a graduate student I studied primarily data-related topics such as big data and AI. In my free time I read and research socio-political topics in technology such as astroturfing, deepfakes, and media manipulation and how it's shaping individual and group behaviours in the era of social media.

I am always interested in learning new technologies and techniques in software engineering. I am extremely interested in everything data: analytics, engineering, and science.
